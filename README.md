# Data Cleaning Exercise Using SQL

### Exercise Overview
An SQL exercise that deals with preparing data for building reports in BI systems. Tasks comprised of cleaning and solving for metric values (i.e. CTR, CPC, CPM, ROMI) using Facebook and Google ads data. Given below are the steps I took in processing the data.

- I. Retrieve the desired data from both Facebook and Google ads table and combined them
- II. Getting the total of each given parameters and extracting the utm_campaign from the url_parameters
- III. Solving for the required metrics
- IV. Obtaining the previous month's metric values
- V. Displaying all the data with the differences between the previous month and current month metric values for comparison

I created a documentation file: [Exercise Documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jX5AxSVV0RDSj-aM6k34cjoTkSaEsal-0L0BDqEQ7nw/edit?usp=sharing) which describes the procedures in detail.

### Data Source
Facebook and Google ads data were provided by [GoIT](https://goit.global/ph/) as part of its course work.

### Tools
For this Exercise, I used DBeaver for data processing.
